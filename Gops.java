/**
 * Game of Pure Strategy (GOPS) aka Goofspiel
 * <p>
 * Goofspiel is played using cards from a standard deck of cards,
 * and is typically a two-player game, although more players are possible.
 * Each suit is ranked A (low), 2, ..., 10, J, Q, K (high).
 * One suit is singled out as the "prizes"; each of the remaining suits becomes
 * a hand for one player, with one suit discarded if there are only two players,
 * or taken from additional decks if there are four or more. The prizes are shuffled
 * and placed between the players with one card turned up.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Play proceeds in a series of rounds. The players make sealed bids for the top
 * (face up) prize by selecting a card from their hand (keeping their choice secret from their
 * opponent).
 * Once these cards are selected, they are simultaneously revealed, and the player making the
 * highest bid takes
 * the competition card. Rules for ties in the bidding vary, possibilities including the
 * competition card being
 * discarded, or its value split between the tied players (possibly resulting in fractional scores).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Some play that the current prize "rolls over" to the next round, so that two or
 * more cards are competed for at once with a single bid card.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The cards used for bidding are discarded, and play continues with a new upturned prize card.
 * After 13 rounds, there are no remaining cards and the game ends. Typically, players earn
 * points equal to sum of the ranks of cards won (i.e. ace is worth one point, 2 is two points,
 * etc., jack 11, queen
 * 12, and king 13 points). Players may agree upon other scoring schemes.
 * </p>
